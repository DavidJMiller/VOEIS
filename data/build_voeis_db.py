"""
Builds the VOEIS database from the raw data and precomputes helpful data.

IMPORTANT: this program should be run within the root directory.

The VOEIS database consists of two plain-text files:
    
    sequences.txt: Records information of the OEIS sequences.
    
        Format: each sequence will be described by one line:
            <a_num>\t<name>\t<terms>
        
        Attributes:
            a_num: The sequence's A-number converted into an integer (without
                the leading "A"). For example, the sequence A000042 will have
                an `a_num` of 42.
            name: The name of the sequence.
            terms: The array of values in the sequences that are converted into
                32-bit integers, separated by spaces. The values that don't fit
                in 32 bits will be thrown away.
    
    numbers.txt: Records the info for the numbers that has appeared across all
        sequences in OEIS.
        
        Format: each number will be described by one line (newlines
            are for decorations only):
            <num> <total_count> <total_num_sequences>\t
            <index_counts>\t
            <offset_neg_6_neighbors>;
            <offset_neg_5_neighbors>;
            <offset_neg_4_neighbors>;
            <offset_neg_3_neighbors>;
            <offset_neg_2_neighbors>;
            <offset_neg_1_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_1_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_2_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_3_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_4_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_5_neighbors>;
            <offset_pos_6_neighbors>
        
        Attributes:
            num: The number whose info is recorded by this object.
            total_count: The total number of times the number has appeared
                across all sequences in OEIS.
            total_num_sequences: The total number of sequences the number has
                appeared in. Not necessarily equal to `total_count` since a
                number may appear multiple times in one sequence.
            index_counts: The number of times the number has appeared in at each
                index across all sequences. For example, a pair "3 42"
                indicates that this number has appeared 42 times as a 3rd
                element of any sequence. Commas separate pairs, and spaces
                separete the two values in the pair.
            offset_SIG_X_neighbors:  The list of "popular neighbors" this
                number has that are `SIG_X` elements away in any sequence. A
                popular neighbor of a number N is another number M that
                frequently appears around N across all sequences. For example, a
                pair "3 42" occurs in `offset_neg_2_neighbors` indicates that
                number 3 appear 2 spots before N in any sequence 42 times. This
                list contains a maximum of twelve most popular neighbors for
                each `SIG_X` and contains `SIG_X`-valued [-6, 6]. Commas
                separate pairs, and spaces separete the two values in the pair.

This program overrides the contents of any existing database files when writing
the new ones.
